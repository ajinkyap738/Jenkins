There are two different type of authtication are in the github
1. SSH authentication
2. Personal access Token (PAT) authentication
    a. Fine-grained personal access tokens
    b. Classic Token


1. SSH key Setup for Git pull Push  

‚úÖ Steps to Fix
1. Check if SSH key exists:
Run the following in your terminal:

ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
or

ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If neither file exists, you need to create an SSH key.

2. Generate a new SSH key (if needed):

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
(Use RSA if you're on an older system: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com")

Just press Enter to accept default file locations. Then start the SSH agent:
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
3. Add the public key to GitHub:
Copy the public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key. Paste the key there.

4. Test SSH connection:

ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a success message like:

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated...

5. Try the push again:

git push -u origin main
Let me know if you want help automating this or checking your SSH key setup.

2. PAT Setup


üîß Step-by-Step: Use Token with HTTPS
1. Generate a GitHub Token
Go to GitHub Token Settings.

Click "Generate new token (classic)" or use "Fine-grained tokens" (recommended for tighter security).

Choose scopes:

For pushing code, check:

repo (for full control of private repos)

workflow (if needed for CI)

Copy the token immediately ‚Äî GitHub won't show it again.

2. Update the Git Remote URL to HTTPS
Check current remote:


git remote -v
If it's SSH (git@github.com:user/repo.git), switch it to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
Replace USERNAME and REPOSITORY with your actual GitHub details.

3. Push Using the Token
When you push:

git push -u origin main
You'll be prompted for a username and password:

Username: your GitHub username

Password: paste your token instead of your real GitHub password

üí° You can also use a credential manager to avoid entering it every time.

============================================================================

If you want to Switch from SSH to HTTPS with Token Authentication


üîÅ 1. Change the Remote URL from SSH to HTTPS
Check current remote:


git remote -v
If it shows something like:

origin  git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git
Change it to HTTPS:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Verify the change:

git remote -v
Now it should show:

origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
üîê 2. Set Up Credential Helper to Store Your Token
Use Git‚Äôs credential helper to store your token securely:

git config --global credential.helper store
This will store credentials in plain text in ~/.git-credentials. If you prefer security, skip this and use a credential manager instead.

üîì 3. Push to Trigger Login Prompt
Now push:

git push -u origin main
Git will prompt you:

Username: your GitHub username

Password: your personal access token (paste it)

If you used credential.helper store, Git will save this token for future use.
