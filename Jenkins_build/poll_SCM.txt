How to Use "Poll SCM" in Jenkins:
1. Go to your Jenkins job configuration.

2. Scroll to the "Build Triggers" section.

3. Check the box for "Poll SCM".

In the Schedule field, enter a cron-style expression to define how often Jenkins should poll the repository.

Cron Syntax (Jenkins-style):
The format is:

	MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
Examples:

H/15 * * * * — Polls every 15 minutes.

H 4 * * 1-5 — Polls at 4 AM on weekdays.

@hourly — Polls once every hour.

H is used to spread out the load on Jenkins if multiple jobs are polling. It hashes the job name to a specific time slot.

Notes:

	Polling ≠ building — Jenkins only triggers a build if it finds changes in the repository.

	Works best with SCMs that support change detection (like Git).
