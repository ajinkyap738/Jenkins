How to Enable and Use "Build periodically":

1. Go to your Jenkins job.

2. Click "Configure".

3. Scroll to the "Build Triggers" section.

4. Check "Build periodically".

5. Enter a schedule using the cron-like syntax.

Cron Syntax in Jenkins

	MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
	MINUTE: 0–59

	HOUR: 0–23

	DOM (Day of Month): 1–31

	MONTH: 1–12

	DOW (Day of Week): 0–7 (0 or 7 = Sunday)

Examples
H 2 * * * — Build daily at 2 AM (H spreads the load)

*/15 * * * * — Build every 15 minutes

H H * * 1-5 — Build once during work hours on weekdays

0 0 * * 0 — Build every Sunday at midnight

The use of H (hash) in Jenkins helps distribute load evenly when many jobs are scheduled at the same time.
