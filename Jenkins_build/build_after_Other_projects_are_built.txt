How to Use "Build after other projects are built"
1. Go to the job configuration of the project you want to trigger after other projects.

2. Scroll to the "Build Triggers" section.

3. Check the box labeled "Build after other projects are built."

4. In the "Projects to watch" field, enter the names of the upstream jobs (comma-separated if multiple).

These must match the exact job names.

5. Click Save.

Important Notes:
The build will trigger only if the upstream projects finish successfully (i.e., with a "stable" result).

This is useful for simple CI/CD pipelines where you want to build/test/deploy in stages.

Example:
If you have:

	Job-A: builds code

	Job-B: runs tests after Job-A

	Job-C: deploys after Job-B

You can configure:

	Job-B with "Build after other projects are built" = Job-A

	Job-C with "Build after other projects are built" = Job-B
