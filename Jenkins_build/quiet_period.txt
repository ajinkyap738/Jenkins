In Jenkins, the quiet period is a configurable delay between when a build is triggered and when it actually starts. This delay is useful in cases where:

Multiple triggers happen in quick succession (e.g., several commits pushed to a repository).

You want to reduce redundant builds by allowing time for other changes to accumulate.

You want to stabilize the environment before a build starts.

How it works:
The default quiet period is 5 seconds.

During this time, if more changes are detected or new triggers arrive, Jenkins merges them into the same build.

The quiet period starts after a job is scheduled, not before.

How to configure it:
Globally: Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System, and scroll down to the "Quiet period" setting.

Per job: In the job configuration page, go to Build Triggers > Advanced, and set the quiet period.
